This device is installed in areas where water levels, such as reservoirs, need to be controlled. When it rains, the device detects the rising water levels to determine if it is raining and displays the humidity and temperature on the screen, as humidity is crucial during rainfall. It operates a relay connected to a water pump to adjust the water level. In situations where the water level is low and there is no rain, a light sensor is utilized to display the intensity of sunlight on the screen.
